      "A broken heart is all that's left",
      "I'm still fixing all the cracks",
      "Lost a couple of pieces when",
      "I carried it, carried it, carried it home",
      "I'm afraid of all I am",
      "My mind feels like a foreign land",
      "Silence ringing inside my head",
      "Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home",
      "I spent all of the love I've saved, we were always a losing game",
      "Small-town boy in a big arcade",
      "I got addicted to a losing game",
      "Ahh, ah",
      "Ooh, ooh",
      "All I know, all I know",
      "Loving you is a losing game",
      "How many pennies in the slot",
      "Giving us up, didn't take a lot",
      "I saw the end before it begun",
      "Still I carried, I carried, I carried on",
      "Ahh, ha",
      "Ooh, ooh",
      "All I know, all I know…",
      "Loving you is a losing game",
      "Ahh, ha",
      "Ooh, ooh",
      "All I know, all I know…",
      "Loving you is a losing game",
      "I don't need your games, game over",
      "Get me off this roller-coaster",
      "Ooh, ooh",
      "All I know, all I know",
      "Loving you is a losing game",
      "Ooh, ooh",
      "All I know, all I know",
      "Loving you is a losing game"
